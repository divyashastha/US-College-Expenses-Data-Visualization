R Text: With the below comments, I am creating new variables (columns) to calculate the Total Income and Expenses per capita, Overall income and expenses 
of individual colleges, overall income and expenses per capita.

Then, I wanted to find the profit per capita for each college so that I will know how profitable universities are functioning and I thought to use 
this information for doing some useful analysis thereafter.

Lastly, I calculated Tuition per capita.

data1 <- df %>%
  mutate('Total_Income_Per_Capita' = Total.Income/Total.Enrollment) %>%
  mutate('Total_Expenses_Per_Capita' = Total.Expenses/Total.Enrollment) %>%
  mutate('Overall.Income' = Total.Income + Tuition + Federal + State + Local + Private + Sales) %>%
  mutate('Overall.Expenses' = Total.Expenses + Research + Public.Service + Student.Services + Instruction + Academic.Support + Other) %>%
  mutate('Overall_Income_Per_Capita' = Overall.Income/Total.Enrollment) %>%
  mutate('Overall_Expenses_Per_Capita' = Overall.Expenses/Total.Enrollment) %>%
  mutate('Profit_Per_Capita' = Overall_Income_Per_Capita - Overall_Expenses_Per_Capita) %>%
  mutate('Tuition_Per_Capita' = Tuition/Total.Enrollment)

head(data1)

R text: I also tried to find the correlation between overall expenses and overall income - A correlation of 0.98 shows that both entities are 
highly correlated, which means that an income for a college is almost always offset by its expenditure. Then, are colleges not running on profit?

cor(data1$Overall.Income, data1$Overall.Expenses)
lm(Overall.Income ~ Overall.Expenses, data = data1)

R text: DATA ANALYSIS 1

This leads to my first analysis: Institutional Profit per capita vs Type of Institutions

From the bar chart below, we can observe that Private non-profit (4 year) type of college makes more profit compared to other institutions. 
As expected, the public colleges make the least profit.

data1 %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarise(Institutional_Profit_Per_Capita = mean(Profit_Per_Capita, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(-Institutional_Profit_Per_Capita) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(type, -Institutional_Profit_Per_Capita) , y = Institutional_Profit_Per_Capita)) + 
  geom_col(position = 'dodge') + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity",fill="purple") +
  xlab("Type of Institution") +  
  ylab("Institution Profit Per Capita") 
  
 R text: DATA ANALYSIS 2

Here, I have done a scatter-plot to analyse the relationship between Overall Income and the amount of money spent on Research (R&D). 
There is a positive correlation (corr=0.81), which shows that colleges allocate funds to research based on the amount of income they generate.

I noticed an anomaly in the data - John Hopkins college (a point on the top left quandrant) spends a significant amount of approximately 
USD 2.91Billion for research. I researched a little more on this topic, and I was surprised to find that Johns Hopkins has led all US universities 
in R&D spending for 42 consecutive year.

R text: DATA ANALYSIS 3

As an international student, I wanted to find out how much students spend in each state on average for their tuition fees. 
I have created a bar chart for top 10 American states with the highest tuition fee. I have ranked the data in the order of most expensive 
tuitions per state to the least. I was surprised to find that Fermont (VT) state has some expensive universities, as I was under the 
impression that Massachusetts (MA) or even New York (NY) would top the list, given the cost of living and some of the best universities 
in the US situated in those states.Â 

data1 %>%
  group_by(STABBR) %>%
  summarise(Avg_Tuition_Per_State_Per_Capita = mean(Tuition_Per_Capita, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(-Avg_Tuition_Per_State_Per_Capita) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(STABBR, -Avg_Tuition_Per_State_Per_Capita), y = Avg_Tuition_Per_State_Per_Capita)) + 
  geom_col(position = 'dodge', fill='lightblue') + 
  gghighlight(max(Avg_Tuition_Per_State_Per_Capita) > 25000) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = sprintf("%0.2f", round(Avg_Tuition_Per_State_Per_Capita, digits = 2)), vjust = 1.5)) +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  xlab("American States") +  
  ylab("Average Tuition Per State Per Student") +
  ggtitle("Top 10 States with Highest Average Tuition Fee") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face='bold'),axis.title = element_text(face='bold'))
